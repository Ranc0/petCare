care_tips = {
    "Rabies": "Ensure your dog is up-to-date on vaccinations. If exposure is suspected, isolate immediately and contact veterinary authorities. Avoid contact with wild animals, and follow quarantine guidelines as required.",

    "Distemper": "Provide supportive care such as hydration, rest, and nutritional support. Isolate the dog from others to prevent spread. Seek veterinary attention for neurological symptoms, and maintain regular vaccinations to prevent recurrence.",

    "Parvovirus": "Seek emergency vet care immediately. Provide IV fluids, monitor for dehydration, and administer anti-nausea medications. Isolate the infected dog and disinfect all surfaces using a bleach solution. Stick to vaccine schedules for prevention.",

    "Hepatitis": "Provide supportive treatment to manage liver inflammation, including fluids and medications prescribed by a vet. Avoid contact with infected urine or feces, and ensure your dog receives routine hepatitis vaccinations.",

    "Tetanus": "Seek immediate veterinary attention. Treatment may include muscle relaxants, antibiotics, and antitoxins. Keep your dog in a quiet environment and minimize stimulation. Prevent future exposure by keeping wounds clean and covered.",

    "Chronic kidney Disease": "Feed a vet-approved renal diet low in protein and phosphorus. Monitor hydration closely and consider subcutaneous fluids. Schedule regular blood and urine tests, and follow veterinary instructions for medication and lifestyle changes.",

    "Diabetes": "Maintain a consistent feeding and insulin schedule. Monitor blood glucose levels regularly. Exercise moderately, and avoid excessive treats. Consult your vet for dietary recommendations and long-term glucose control strategies.",

    "Gastrointestinal Disease": "Feed a bland, easily digestible diet. Provide hydration and monitor stool consistency. Avoid table scraps and possible food allergens. Seek veterinary guidance for persistent symptoms or if parasites are suspected.",

    "Allergies": "Identify and eliminate allergens through diet trials or environmental changes. Use prescribed antihistamines or corticosteroids. Bathe your dog with medicated shampoo to relieve skin irritation. Consult your vet for allergy testing.",

    "Gingivitis": "Brush your dog's teeth regularly with canine-safe toothpaste. Provide dental chews or toys. Schedule professional cleanings with your vet and monitor for bleeding or signs of oral pain. Diet changes may also help reduce plaque buildup.",

    "Cancers": "Follow your vet's oncology plan, which may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Monitor lumps and physical changes. Provide a nutrient-rich diet and comfort-focused care. Keep activity low and reduce stress.",

    "Skin Rashes": "Use hypoallergenic shampoos or topical treatments prescribed by your vet. Prevent flea and mite exposure with monthly preventatives. Limit scratching using e-collars or soothing sprays. Rule out food allergies or autoimmune conditions.",

    "Leptospirosis": "Administer prescribed antibiotics promptly and maintain hydration. Avoid exposure to standing water and control rodents in the dog's environment. Use gloves when cleaning up urine due to zoonotic risk, and disinfect contaminated areas.",

    "Kennel Cough": "Minimize activity and stress. Use a humidifier or steam to ease breathing, and provide a warm, quiet recovery space. Mild cases may resolve on their own, but severe coughing may require antibiotics or cough suppressants.",
